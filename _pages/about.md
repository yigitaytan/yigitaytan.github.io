I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google, where I build software to deploy data safely at scale.
Previously, I worked on [Google Web Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Server).

I specialize in:

* distributed computing
* highly available production infrastructure
* low latency serving systems

I studied Computer Science and Business Administration with a minor in Mathematics at [University of Richmond](https://richmond.edu). After two college summer internships with Google,
I joined [Google Cambridge](https://careers.google.com/locations/cambridge/) full-time in 2012 after completing my college education.

In addition to spending time with my family, I like to sail keelboats in the Massachusetts Bay during the summer months and go skiing in New England in the winter.
